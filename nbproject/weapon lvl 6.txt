WEI [WEI6TH]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character:  Xiahou Dun
Stage:      Pacification of Jing Province [Wei Xtreme Stage 5]
Condition:  Defeat Guan Ping, Guan Xing and Guan Suo within 9 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: North of Guan Yu's main camp.
Weapon:     Frozen Fang
            Base Attack: 59 
            Frost 10, Barricade 9, Fear 9, Induction 9, Desperation
Details:    This is a fight where you'll have to defeat multiple officers 
quickly and having Cyclone on your weapon will help a lot.  Not because of 
having to eliminate the sons of Yu, but when you approach the central hill, Wu 
reinforcements will arrive and will take out your forces to the northeast that 
are defending the main camp; not to mention that the boost in enemy morale will
give Cao Cao problems to the northwest.

From the starting position in the northeast, head southwest to the bottom of the
hill where Ma Liang is stationed.  You may take out Wang Fu along the way, since
that will help the officers to the northeast survive a little longer.  In any 
case, Guan Suo will drop down from the hill and attack you.  Defeat Guan Suo and
Ma Liang to get the ladder set up in place.  There maybe dialog spam that will 
take place.  Climb up the ladder and defeat Guan Ping at the top of the hill.  

By now, the Wu reinforcements will be pushing towards the main camp, head them 
off and defeat them ASAP.  Cao Cao will still be hanging in there to the 
northwest, but rush over to his side once the northeast area is under control. 
Clear out the troops around Cao Cao and head down to the south.  Guan Xing will 
arrive near the gate.  Defeat him and if everything is taken care of within 9 
minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

Character:  Dian Wei
Stage:      Mt. Dingjun Rescue Mission [Wei Xtreme Stage 3]
Condition:  Destroy all of the ballistae and juggernauts and defeat Fa Zheng
            within 3 minutes after the rock attack starts.
Weapon Box: East of Zhuge Liang's main camp.
Weapon:     Thunder Axe
            Base Attack: 61
            Thunder 10, Explosive 9, Flurry 9, Whirlwind 9, Thorns 8
Details:    Fairly self-explanatory for Dian Wei's requirements.  Play the stage
as normal until you get Guo Jia's request to head down the eastern path after 
Shu's forces begin their retreat.  Zhang Bao and ballistae are set up in the 
center portion of the map.  Eliminate them.  Head over to the southeast where 
you'll find Yueying and the juggernauts.  Eliminate them.  Head westward and 
you'll get the message that Fa Zheng has begun his rock attack.  This is when 
the timer will start.  You'll get ambushed by Ma Chao and Ma Dai with cavalry 
units along the way up the hill.  You can ignore them and rush over to Fa Zheng 
and defeat him before the 3 minutes are up.  If you are successful, you'll get a
treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhang Liao
Stage:      Assault on Wujun [Lu Bu Hypothetical Stage 7]
Condition:  Carry out Chen Gong's plot within 7 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: In the center garrison where Chen Gong prepares his ambush.
Weapon:     Shadow Slayers
            Base Attack: 56
            Slash 10, Chain 9, Protection 8, Spurt 8, Agility
Details:    This is a fight where you'll need to follow Chen Gong's instructions
as well as defeat officers at a swift clip.  Move from the northeast to the 
northwest defeating ambush troops along the way.  Chen Gong will then ask you to
find the ambush troops in the western castle.  Search the area until you find 
Han Dang and company.  Once you defeat the ambush pincer attack unit within the 
7 minute time limit, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Cao Cao
Stage:      Pacification of Jing Province [Wei Xtreme Stage 5]
Condition:  Defeat Lu Meng and Lu Xun within 6 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: Near Guan Suo's initial location.
Weapon:     Storm Sword
            Base Attack: 52
            Cyclone 10, Fear 9, Harmony 9, Spurt 8, Chain 8
Details:    The approach to get Cao Cao's 6th weapon is similar to Xiahou Dun's 
path described earlier in the guide.  Defeating Ma Liang at the base of the hill
will trigger the arrival of the Wu reinforcements.  Once they arrive, head over 
to the east and head them off before they reach the main camp.  Lu Xun and Lu 
Meng are among the reinforcements.  Defeat the two of them within 6 minutes and 
you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Xu Zhu
Stage:      Defense of Xinye [Wei Xtreme Stage 6, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Defeat Liao Hua within 8 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: At the open area between the two garrisons south of the Eight
            Gates Formation.
Weapon:     Crystal Cleaver
            Base Attack: 56
            Frost 10, Recovery 9, Jolt 9, Flurry 8, Awareness
Details:    Most of the instructions for obtaining the 6th weapons are 
straightforward and relatively painless.  This one is no exception.  

Rescue your allied officers along the way to the south by defeating the enemy 
officers that they are engaged with.  To get to the second officer pairing, 
you'll need to ride a horse and jump to reach the platform and get to the gate 
on the other side.  Liao Hua is a gatekeeper and isn't engaged with an allied 
officer.  Defeat him to reach Cao Ren.  If you defeat Liao Hua within the 8 
minute mark, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Xiahou Yuan
Stage:      Battle of Zitong [Wei Xtreme Stage 7]
Condition:  Defeat Huang Zhong and Yan Yan within 5 minutes after Huang Zhong's
            arrow attack starts.
Weapon Box: East of Huang Zhong's location.
Weapon:     Dawn Bringer
            Base Attack: 52
            Flash 10, Whirlwind 9, Survival 9, Fear 8, Awareness
Details:    Start the stage by clearing out the enemy officers near the main 
camp.  Next, Zhang He will head over to the supply depot to the west.  He'll get
ambushed.  Defeat the ambush unit lead by Zhang Bao.  Go outside of the supply 
depot to the west.  Head along to the path to the south and you will run into 
some message spam.  Ma Chao and Ma Dai will head to the main camp with their 
cavalry units.  Next is the arrow attack from Huang Zhong.  

Go to the raised path in the center and you'll first run into Yan Yan.  Defeat 
him and a bit further along, you'll run into Old Man #2.  The archery volley 
that comes from the peons can be brutal, but having a horse with the Shadow 
ability as well as Secret Arts will help nullify that.  If you defeat Yan Yan 
and Huang Zhong within the time limit, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Xu Huang
Stage:      Defense of Chang'an [Wei Xtreme Stage 2]
Condition:  Defeat Cheng Yi, Zhang Heng and Han Sui within 4 minutes of
            starting the battle without losing a single allied officer.
Weapon Box: The open area across the river south from Xu Huang's starting
            location.
Weapon:     Sharp Destruction
            Base Attack: 61
            Cyclone 10, Barricade 9, Aggression 9, Jubilation 8, Harmony 8
Details:    From your starting position, head over to the southwest and you'll 
run into Cheng Yi.  Zhang Heng's starting position is southwest of Cheng Yi's, 
however while you're taking care of Cheng Yi, Zhang Heng will come out towards 
your position and you can take care of both of them fairly quickly.  Han Sui is 
in the back of the castle, so go in a counter-clockwise route inside the castle 
to reach him.  Once Han Sui is defeated and all of your allies are accounted for
within 4 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhang He
Stage:      Battle of Zitong [Wei Xtreme Stage 7]
Condition:  Protect the front lines and defeat the ambush units at the
            supply depot within 6 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: Northwest of the supply depot.
Weapon:     Demon Summoners
            Base Attack: 37
            Slash 10, Survival 9, Thorns 8, Resolve, Agility
Details:    The procedure for Zhang He's 6th weapon is the same listed as the 
first steps outlined for Xiahou Yuan (The only difference is that you're playing
as Zhang He when the ambush occurs in the supply depot :P).  Once you beat Zhang
Bao within the first 6 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Cao Ren
Stage:      Defense of Fan Castle [Wei Xtreme Stage 4]
Condition:  Carry out the Wei Forces' water attack within 11 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: East of the center bridge on the battlefield.
Weapon:     Steel Fang and Scale
            Base Attack: 62
            Cyclone 10, Velocity 9, Triumph 9, Swiftness, Resolve
Details:    If the conditions for obtaining Cao Ren's 6th weapon sound familiar,
it's because they're the same requirements needed to obtain Yu Jin's 5th weapon.
The only difference is that you are given more time to finish the strategy (11 
minutes vs. 9).

For the uninformed, go outside to the front of Fan Castle.  Wu will send out 
several officers to attack.  Yu Jin's instructions are to lure the Wu forces 
inside the castle.  The targeted officers will be flashing in green and by 
approaching them, they will pursue you.  After you attract about two or three 
officers, Guan Yu will announce that he will send messengers to halt the flood 
attack.  The next step is to put the luring mission on hold and defeat the 
messengers.

The three messengers will head to the Wu camp to the southeast.  Head down to 
the south of the castle and head to the area where the two lower paths meet up 
to the west of the Wu camp.  The two messengers will run towards that spot 
nearly at the same time and you can take care of them.  The third messenger will
come from the northwest and will take a longer time to reach the Wu camp, so you
can head to where he is at (refer to the in-game map if necessary).  Once the 
messengers are taken care of, resume luring the Wu officers inside Fan Castle.  
Funnel them along to the eastern gate.  Once you get the Wu officers inside, 
they will halt their pursuit of you and you can exit the castle to the north, 
then west.

Next up, Guan Yu will dismiss Guan Ping from the floodgates leaving Guan Suo 
behind.  Head over to Guan Suo's position and defeat him to open the floodgates.
Once the floodgates are open, Wu will think that Shu was responsible for the 
flood attack and will withdrawal from the battle.  If this is done within 11 
minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Cao Pi
Stage:      Final Conflict at Guandu [Wei Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat Zhenji within 10 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: At the northeast corner of the center castle south of the river.
Weapon:     Swallow Blades
            Base Attack: 53
            Cyclone 10, Frenzy 9, Flurry 8, Jolt 8, Swiftness
Details:    Zhenji is holed up at Yanjin-North Base and it will take some 
completed tasks in order for you to get to her.

First off, eliminate the peons that are around the base to the south.  Once 
that's done, Yuan Shao will send some Unit Commanders to attack the base.  Next 
up is that you're asked to take care of the officers that are responsible for 
three forts.  I would suggest going to the center first, then the southwest and 
the west last.  Cross the river to the north and Zhang He will come after you.  
Defeat him in order to get the location of the supply depot (The supply depot is
located to the northwest).  Defeat Wen Chou to set fire to the supply depot. 

Now is the time to defeat Zhenji.  Approach the northern door of the base and 
she will pursue you.  Defeat her within the 10 minute time limit and you'll get 
a treasure message.

*If you're moving along at a good pace defeating enemies, Lu Bu will remain on 
your side.  When I got the weapon, I let the messengers get to Lu Bu and got the
weapon message before Lu Bu defected.  So it may or may not matter if Lu Bu is 
on your side in order to get the weapon.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhenji
Stage:      Melee at Chibi [Others Xtreme Stage 4, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Prevent the enemy's fire attack and defeat Han Dang within 9
            minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: At the dead end north of Han Dang's initial location.
Weapon:     Spring Thunder
            Base Attack: 44
            Thunder 10, Jolt 9, Uplift 9, Vigor 8, Agility
Details:    From the starting position to the south, head to the west and defeat
the group of officers in that direction.  At this point, Wu will send its fire 
attack units from three ships.  Defeat them by moving from the south to north, 
making sure that your allied officers don't lose to the fire attack units.  When
all three areas are secure, head down to the ship to the south and ride it down
to the Wu shore.  Once the ship comes to a stop, climb the ladder and you will
find Han Dang at the top.  Defeat him to open up the garrison.  If all of this
is accomplished in the first 9 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.  

You may have to destroy the ballista in the room adjacent to where the weapon 
box is in order to open the door.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Cai Wenji
Stage:      Find the Beauties [Wei Xtreme Stage 8, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Find all the beauties [10 not including Lu Lingqi].
Weapon Box: At the garrison where Xiaoqiao and Zhou Yu first appear.
Weapon:     Heaven's Banquet
            Base Attack: 40
            Flash 10, Spurt 9, Barricade 9, Velocity 8, Thorns 8
Details:    This is arguably one of the toughest 6th weapons to obtain in the 
game.  The name of the game is speed here, so having Red Hare is a must.  If you
want to try to Zhou Tai katana jump-cancel movement trick for a challenge, feel 
free.  In any case, you'll have to chase down numerous targets in this stage.  

The first set of bandits that you have to track down will try to escape the 
stage.  The first one will appear to just to the west of your starting location 
heading west; the second will be to the north of your starting location, heading
north then west; the third will be to the far northeast and will head to the 
northwest.  It's suggested to take out the bandit leaders in the order that I've
mentioned.  Don't worry about going into the garrisons until after the bandits 
are defeated.  The garrisons that are highlighted are to the northwest, 
northeast and southwest.  The northwest and northeast can be visited in either 
order, but be sure to go the southwest garrison last.  The couples that are 
inside are Sun Ce and Daqiao to the northwest, Guan Suo and Bao Sanniang to the 
northeast and Sima Zhao and Wang Yuanji to the southwest.  Defeat each couple 
and the next sequence will begin.  

The second set of bandits feature them attacking handmaidens.  One to the north,
the second in the central area and the third is below the platform that you 
should be at in the southwest area.  Defeating the bandits will free the 
handmaidens and will go to nearby garrisons and wait.  Start by going down from 
the platform and defeating the bandit in the southwest area.  Again, you can 
take your time following the handmaidens to the garrison, it's more important to
rescue the other handmaidens.  The next stop is the northern garrison and the 
third is the central area.  This is the suggested order to go visit the 
handmaidens in the garrisons.  To the west features Liu Bei and Sun Shangxiang; 
to the north, Sima Shi and Zhang Chunhua and to the north-central garrison, 
Zhang Fei and Xingcai.  It's also suggested that you place some bodyguards in 
the Secure Position Battle Skill at the Eastern Midslope Garrison Southwest 
(i.e., the lower-level path where you found the handmaiden that's responsible 
for Xingcai).  Once you've finished off Zhang Fei and Xingcai last, rush over to
the southeast and drop down to the area where you placed your bodyguards.  

The third sequence will begin and can be the most frustrating part of this 
quest.  You'll have to chase down more bandits, and they will spread out from 
the initial spot where you placed your bodyguards.  Hopefully, they will provide
enough interference, so that they won't go into their full sprint.  Try to 
eliminate all 6 in the same spot with a musou attack.  If you're not successful 
with the first attack, three bandits will head to the south and will split off 
to the east and west from there.   The three bandits to the north will split to 
the west and east once they get to the open field.  I took the bandits to the 
south while they were still going in a straight line, and therefore was a bit 
easier to round up and finish off.  Make sure to take care of all three bandit 
units as the crowd can obfuscate the view a bit.  Once the south is taken care 
of, rush to the north and take care of the remaining three.  They may start to 
split off from that point so do your best to take care of the two that head west
and the one to the east.  If you take care of the bandits successfully, take the
animals to the designated spots.  To the southwest, you'll take the tigers there
and you'll meet Zhuge Liang and Yueying.  Defeat them.  Take the pandas to the 
central garrison and you'll meet Zhou Yu and Xiaoqiao.  Defeat them as well.

Once that's done, head over to the eastern area and go to each highlighted spot.
The two areas have three unit commanders each.  Defeat them within the time 
limit to reveal the next couples.  They are Meng Huo and Zhurong to the west and
Guan Ping and Guan Yinping to the east.  Once the second of the two beauties are
revealed, you'll get a treasure message.

beauties so you'll have a little margin for error.  If you execute the same 
approach with Cai Wenji as Yue Jin, you'll get a treasure message after the 
first of two beauty appearances in the caves to the east.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Li Dian
Stage:      Find the Beauties [Wei Xtreme Stage 8]
Condition:  Find at least 7 beauties.
Weapon Box: At the southwest junction near the eastern bridge on the
            battlefield.
Weapon:     Sirius Wind
            Base Attack: 61
            Cyclone 10, Velocity 9, Barricade 9, Aggression 8, Awareness
Details:    Wow, now 7 is the magic number.  Again, follow Cai Wenji's procedure
and if done correctly, you'll get a treasure message after defeating the first 
of the two animal herding bandits, then have a beauty appear at that garrison.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Yu Jin
Stage:      Pacification of Jing Province [Wei Xtreme Stage 5]
Condition:  Successfully place the ladder and defeat Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei
            within 8 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: North of Guan Yu's main camp.
Weapon:     Heaven Conqueror
            Base Attack: 56
            Inferno 10, Jolt 9, Velocity 8, Explosive 8, Agility
Details:    At the start of the stage, head over to the foot of the central hill
and defeat Guan Suo and Ma Liang to get the ladder set up in place.  Again, be 
sure to defeat the Wu forces to the east to prevent your main camp being 
overrun.  A rage attack is useful to eliminate everyone quickly.

When you get close to Guan Yu, Shu reinforcements will arrive.  Specifically, 
Zhao Yun will appear in the northwest garrison and head towards Cao Cao while 
Zhang Fei will arrive to the southwest, go to the southeast corner of the map, 
then will head north.  It may take some riding around to track them down, but if
the two of them are defeated in the first 8 minutes (as well as the ladder being
set up), you'll get a treasure message.

WU [WU6TH]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character:  Zhou Yu
Stage:      Invasion of Runan [Wu Xtreme Stage 2]
Condition:  Find the assault unit after defeating Li Dian and Yue Jin.
Weapon Box: The north end of the east pathway the assault unit is traveling.
Weapon:     Light-Breaking Staff
            Base Attack: 46
            Flash 10, Whirlwind 9, Frenzy 9, Aggression 8, Thorns 8
Details:    This battle is another test on how quickly you can defeat officers 
in a short amount of time.  Having Red Hare will help immensely in this fight as
well.

From the starting position in the south, head over to center of the bridge area 
to the northwest.  Guo Jia will raise the drawbridge and will send Li Dian, Yue 
Jin, Cheng Yu and Cao Anmin as ambush units.  Fortunately, you'll only need to 
defeat the first two on the list.  This is a lucky break since while you're in 
the midst of fighting off the ambush, Guo Jia will send troops from the east to 
attack.  You will have 1 minute from when Guo Jia issues the order until the 
assault unit arrives outside your main camp.  If the assault unit arrives at its
destination, Yuan Shu will freak out and you will fail. 

This is where having a fast horse helps.  Once you defeat Li Dian and Yue Jin, 
rush over to where the byroad area is to the southeast of the map.  The assault 
unit is not shown on the map, but they are visible when you approach them along 
the byroad.  If you catch them before they reach the main camp, the assault unit
will mention that they have been spotted and you'll get a treasure message.  At 
this point, you might as well wipe out the assault unit and finish the stage as 
normal.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Lu Xun

Weapon:     Glass Dart
            Base Attack: 44
            Flash 10, Vigor 9, Frenzy 9, Morass 8, Greed
Details:    Another fairly straightforward procedure for this 6th weapon.  Make 
sure that you leave your bodyguards out of this fight since they can steal your 
kills and lower your kill count.

To begin the stage, go south as the map suggests and eliminate as many peons as 
possible to get to 100.  A third of the way through, Cheng Yu enters the fray.  
At the two-thirds mark, Jiang Gan makes an appearance.  At 100 kills, Guo Jia 
shows up.  Once you defeat all three officers, the next corridor will open up.  
Eliminate Zhuangzi inside the room within the 6 minute time limit and you'll get
a treasure message.  Be sure to defeat Zhaungzi before taking out the altars, 
otherwise he'll retreat once they're destroyed and you won't get the weapon.

            Venom 10, Roar 9, Jubilation 8, Flurry 8, Rigidity
Details:    Each of these three officers listed will appear as reinforcements as
you progress through the stage.  After defeating the forces outside the castle 
gates, Cao Ren with some officers will appear to the east.  After defeating 
them, Xu Huang along with more officers will appear to the northeast.  Defeat 
them and enter the castle from the east.  Once Xu Huang's reinforcements are 
defeated, Yu Jin will appear from the west near the castle gate.  Defeat Cai Mao
at the gate to open it from the inside.  From there, defeat Yu Jin.  If all of 
this is accomplished within 10 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

            Base Attack: 48
            Flash 10, Vigor 9, Explosive 9, Frenzy 8, Thorns 8
Details:    To secure the supplies to the main camp, eliminate the ambush unit 
which is made up of Wang Yi, Man Chong and Han Hao.  After this is done, Sun 
Sheng will head over to the main camp.  Also, be sure to fend off the fire 
attack units to assure the safety of the main camp.  After Ding Feng and Lianshi
arrive and eliminating Zhang He and Cao Ren, go after Zhang Liao who is 
stationed towards the western area of the map.  Defeat him and you'll get a 
treasure message.

            Base Attack: 59
            Thunder 10, Protection 9, Roar 8, Uplift 8, Rigidity
Details:    Play the stage as normal until you approach Cao Cao's main camp.  At
that point, he will leave westward and will attack your main camp.  In the 
meantime, defeat Cao Pi, Xu Zhu, Guo Jia and Cui Yan inside castle within 5 
minutes after Cao Cao vacates and you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Taishi Ci
Stage:      Battle of Lujiang [Wu Xtreme Stage 4]
Condition:  Defeat Zhang Liao, Jia Xu and Yu Jin within 10 minutes of
            starting the battle.

Weapon:     Frozen Demon Rods
            Base Attack: 65
            Frost 10, Morass 9, Harmony 9, Whirlwind 8, Fury
Details:    From the starting position in the northwest, head a short distance 
east, drop down and go around and rescue your officers in the garrison.  Once 
you get your allies settled down, the Wu plot will begin.  

Head over to the center of the northeast fort.  Defeat the gatekeeper who will 
lead to the first target for the weapon, Zhang Liao.  Once you defeat him, you 
can drop down from the platform and take care of Jia Xu to the east and Yu Jin 
to the south.  If you accomplish defeating these three officers within 10 
minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Lu Meng
Stage:      Pursuit at Yiling [Wu Xtreme Stage 6]
Condition:  Defeat Feng Xi within 10 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: At the garrison west of the south reinforcement gate.
Weapon:     Dragon's Jaw
            Base Attack: 56
            Slash 10, Awe 9, Roar 9, Harmony 8, Protection 8
Details:    Lu Meng's task in this stage is to play decoy while the little pyro 
Zhu Ran gets to work up north.

Start off by defeating the enemy officers near the main camp.  When that's done,
eliminate the officers that are in the southern garrisons.  Intermittently, Shu 
will send officers to your location, so stay alert.  If you keep repelling the 
Shu forces, eventually they will send a pincer attack unit.  To the northwest of
that pincer, you'll find Feng Xi.  He will be accompanied by juggernauts, so 
take care when facing him.  If you are able to defeat Feng Xi within the first 
10 minutes of battle, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Huang Gai
Stage:      Assault on Shouchun [Wu Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat Jia Xu and Li Dian within 3 minutes of breaking through
            the southeast garrison.
Weapon Box: At the open area west of Cao Cao's main camp.
Weapon:     Imperial Warship
            Base Attack: 66
            Inferno 10, Velocity 9, Harmony 9, Induction 8, Morass 8
Details:    Proceed through the stage as normal by completing the tasks in the 
southern portion of the map.  When you defeat the two officers in the 
southeastern fort, rush up and take care of Jia Xu and Li Dian.  The former will
activate the ballistae, so be sure to have Secret Arts set up or an animal with 
the Shadow ability.  Defeat both Jia Xu and Li Dian within the 3 minute time 
frame and you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhou Tai
Stage:      Invasion of Runan [Wu Xtreme Stage 2]
Condition:  Defeat Guo Jia and Xiahou Dun within 7 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: At the garrison southeast of Xiahou Dun's initial location.
Weapon:     Dazzler
            Base Attack: 48
            Cyclone 10, Chain 9, Barricade 9, Spurt 8, Agility
Details:    This is a stage where life would be easier to take out groups of 
extraneous officers instead of charging in and dispatching the required 
officers.

First, take care of the ambush unit to the northwest of your starting location.
Afterwards, head over to the east of the main camp and defeat the assault unit.
This may take valuable time, but it will help keep Yuan Shu alive.

After beating the assault unit, cross the river north along the eastern road.  
Defeat Xiahou Yuan to open up the garrison and maneuver past the arbalests to 
find Guo Jia in the western fort.  Defeat him and head over to the castle to the
northwest.  Defeat Xiahou Dun inside.  If this is accomplished within 7 minutes 
(i.e., before Cao Cao shows up), you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Ling Tong
Stage:      Assault on Xiangyang [Wu Xtreme Stage 5]

            battle.

            Base Attack: 47
            Slash 10, Survival 9, Protection 8, Velocity 8, Greed
Details:    Head up the trail and defeat the first officer along the way.  Go to
the front of the castle gate and defeat the two officers stationed there.  

Now Cao Ren will bring reinforcements over to the east.  At this point, the 
byroad to the eastern entrance to the castle will be open, so go ahead and rush 
over to the eastern byroad while ignoring Cao Ren, Xu Huang et. al.  Head over 
to the front gate and defeat Cai Mao to open it.  If the gate is open within the
first 6 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Sun Ce

Condition:  Defeat Chen Deng before the [east] mountain gate is smashed and
            without a single allied officer being forced to escape.
Weapon Box: At the north east corner outside the center garrison defended by
            Chen Deng.
Weapon:     Icicle Tonfa
            Base Attack: 44
            Frost 10, Spurt 9, Triumph 9, Fear 8, Velocity 8
Details:    The procedure here won't take very long.  Go to the western path and
defeat Zhang Fei in the southern garrison to clear it.  It won't take long for 
Zhou Yu's unit to get the east gate broken after the catapult gets set up, so 
charge to the garrison in the northeastern area where you'll find Chen Deng.  
Defeat him before the gate is destroyed and you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Sun Quan
Stage:      Battle of Lujiang [Wu Xtreme Stage 4]

            east corner of the open area.
Weapon:     Blazing Wolf
            Base Attack: 62
            Inferno 10, Jubilation 9, Flurry 9, Awe 8, Rigidity
Details:    The steps here are similar to obtaining Taishi Ci's 6th weapon.  The
only difference here is that you can indiscriminately defeat officers to the 
northeast in order to get Cao Cao's secondary unit to your position.  Once the 
officers move to the northeast, Zhou Yu will attack Cao Cao's main camp.  If the
raid is completed within the first 9 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Xiaoqiao
Stage:      Battle of Lujiang [Wu Xtreme Stage 4, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Defeat Xiahou Dun, Hua Xin, Xu Xuan within 8 minutes of starting the
            battle.

Weapon:     Incense Fan
            Base Attack: 43
            Inferno 10, Thorns 8, Awareness, Resolve, Agility
Details:    Follow the procedure of luring troops to the northeast maze.  Keep 
in mind that the officers that are sent to the northeast are Xiahou Dun, Hua Xin
and Xu Xuan.  Xiahou Dun and Hua Xin will circle around counter-clockwise and 
will appear to the north of Zhang Liao's initial spot.  Xu Xuan will stick 
around to the south of Zhang Liao's initial spot on the lower platforms.  Defeat
the two officers to the north first and then navigate your way to the south and 
beat Xu Xuan.  If the three officers are defeated within the first 8 minutes, 
you'll get a treasure message.

*First time I did this, I actually charged from the south and fulfilled the 
requirements just fine.  It's just that your forces will be at a big 
disadvantage moralewise and you'll have to do some babysitting to make sure your
commanders survive the rest of the stage.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Daqiao
Stage:      Assault on Xu Province [Wu Xtreme Stage 3, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Personally defeat Zhang Fei and Guan Yu before Liu Bei starts to

Weapon:     Misery Sticks
            Base Attack: 38
            Venom 10, Frenzy 9, Fear 8, Velocity 8, Fury
Details:    Head over to the west and defeat Zhang Fei in the garrison.  Next, 
backtrack and head over to the eastern garrison.  You may have to help out Zhou 
Yu's squad by defeating the officer guarding the gate and get the catapult set 
up.  Once the gate is destroyed, move in and defeat Guan Yu.  If this is done 
within the first 5 minutes of the stage, you'll get a treasure message.

Weapon:     Flashing Wind God
            Base Attack: 61
            Cyclone 10, Enlightenment 9, Explosive 9, Survival 8, Awareness
Details:    This requirements are similar to Gan Ning's 6th weapon, except the 
target here is Zhang He.  Once the supplies have been delivered and the fire 
attack has been stopped, you can charge over to Zhang He to the northwest, or 
you can wait for him to come to you.  Once Zhang He is defeated, you'll get a 
treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Lianshi
Stage:      Assault on Xu Province [Wu Xtreme Stage 3, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Defeat Chen Gong before he arrives in Sun Ce' main camp.
Weapon Box: South of the northern catapults' setup location, near the stairs.
Weapon:     Peng Crossbow
            Base Attack: 52
            Frost 10, Aggression 9, Awe 9, Triumph 8, Jubilation 8
Details:    Proceed through the stage as normal.  When the two-pronged attack is
a success, Liu Bei will open the gates to the castle.  This is your cue to head 
over to the southwest garrison since that is where Lu Bu's army will show up.  
Chen Gong is among the litany of officers, go ahead and defeat him as well as 
the rest of Lu Bu's squad.  If Chen Gong is defeated and doesn't reach the main 
camp, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Lu Su

Condition:  Defeat Xun You, Xun Yu and Zhang Lu within 6 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: At the area in the center of the battlefield.
Weapon:     Suzaku's Claws
            Base Attack: 60
            Inferno 10, Velocity 8, Flurry 8, Swiftness, Greed
Details:    The procedure is similar of that to Lu Xun's, but the enemy officers
are different.  Xun You will appear a third of the way to 100, Xun Yu at two-
thirds, and Jia Xu will appear at 100 kills.  Defeat the mystic Zhang Lu before 
disabling the sorcery.  If this is completed in the first 6 minutes, you'll get 
a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Han Dang
Stage:      Assault on Shouchun [Wu Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat Yue Jin, Dong Xi and Han Hao within 3 minutes of seeing
            through the ambush.
Weapon Box: At the area east of Yue Jin's ambush location.
Weapon:     Thunderbolt Pike
            Base Attack: 56
            Thunder 10, Recovery 9, Fear 9, Frenzy 8, Chain 8
Details:    This is one of the easier 6th weapons to obtain.  Force Cao Cao's 
army to retreat in the beginning of the stage.  When you reach the southeastern 
area of the map, the game will ask you to search the garrisons to the north to 
look for ambushes.  Yue Jin will mention that they have been spotted and the 
timer will begin.  Defeat Yue Jin, Dong Xi and Han Hao before time expires and 
you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhu Ran
Stage:      Defense of Jiangling [Wu Xtreme Stage 7]
Condition:  Prevent the fire attack on the main camp and defeat Zhang Liao.
Weapon Box: In the northwest garrison on the battlefield.
Weapon:     Dragon King's Wave
            Base Attack: 52
            Venom 10, Roar 9, Harmony 9, Uplift 8, Desperation
Details:    This stage is similar to Gan Ning's 6th weapon procedure, only 
you're concerned about a fire attack.  After the main camp supply line has been 
taken care of, Zhang He will send a fire attack captain from the north to set 
the main camp ablaze.  Eliminate him.  Once the first threat is squelched, Jia 
Xu will send another captain from the southwest.  After the one from the 
southwest is defeated, another one will come from the north and another from the
south.  After all four fire attack captains have been eliminated, go after Zhang
Liao to the west and defeat him once your reinforcements arrive.  If the 
aforementioned is achieved, you'll get a treasure message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SHU [SHU6TH]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Character:  Zhao Yun
Stage:      Escape from Jiangdong [Shu Xtreme Stage 3]
Condition:  Defeat Pan Zhang, Jiang Qin and Quan Zong within 14 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: In the southwest corner of the castle where the 3 enemy
            reinforcements first appear.
Weapon:     Dark Dragon Spear
            Base Attack: 62
            Venom 10, Chain 9, Awe 8, Protection 8, Swiftness
Details:    Proceed through the stage as normal by clearing as many troops as 
possible for Liu Bei and Sun Shangxiang to escape.  The door to the north that 
leads westward will open once you defeat 200 enemies, so reach that quota as 
quickly as possible.

Once you leave the castle, the retaliatory forces will appear in the southern 
part of the castle.  They also happen to be the officers that you need to defeat
in order to get Zhao Yun's 6th weapon.  Defeat them within the 14 minute time 
limit and you'll get a treasure message.  

Keep in mind that Liu Bei and Sun Shangxiang will advance to the southwest and 
will run into some ballistae.  That and fighting Zhou Yu, Lu Meng and company 
will eat at their life, so defeating the retaliatory forces quickly and riding a
fast horse over to the southwest will help the happy couple survive. 

********************************************************************************

Character:  Guan Yu
Stage:      Defeat Lu Bu [Shu Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat Zhang Liao and Lu Lingqi within 9 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: In the square area west of Chen Gong's initial position.
Weapon:     Heavenly Dragon
            Base Attack: 61
            Flash 10, Flurry 9, Awe 8, Fear 8, Resolve
Details:    Zhang Liao and Lu Lingqi are inside the castle to start the stage 
with the gates tightly shut, so the goal here is to force Lu Bu's forces to open
the gates.  

Start by taking the garrisons that surround the castle by defeating the officers
inside them.  Once the garrisons are taken over, catapults will be built and 
will begin to fire onto the castle.  Some enemy officers will leap from the 
castle walls and try to destroy the catapults.  Defeat that vanguard unit and Lu
Bu will open the gates to the castle.  You can defeat Lu Bu if you like (he 
reappears in the throne room in the north-central area if you beat him) and go 
after Zhang Liao and Lu Lingqi from there.  If you defeat the two of them within
9 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhang Fei
Stage:      Clash at Changban [Shu Xtreme Stage 2]
Condition:  Personally defeat Zhang Liao after carrying out Xu Shu's plot
            successfully.
Weapon Box: At the garrison west of Zhang Liao's initial position.
Weapon:     Miraculous Serpent Blade
            Base Attack: 67
            Inferno 10, Thorns 9, Whirlwind 9, Protection 8, Aggression 8
Details:    Another straightforward fight as it relies heavily on Xu Shu's 
strategy.

First, clear the garrisons highlighted of enemy officers.  The ally officers who
are responsible for each garrison will run straight toward their respective 
spots, so there isn't much worry for keeping them alive.  You have 5 minutes to 
take the garrisons, so time is a bit of an issue.  Once all four garrisons are 
clear, Cao Cao's main forces will show up.

Next, Xu Shu will ask you to lure the enemy to the central area.  Just approach 
Xu Zhu, Zhang He and Xiahou Yuan and they will charge to the center from there. 
Once everyone is at the center, Xu Shu will give the signal and the ambush units
will come out of their hiding spots.  From there defeat the foes in the center 
and more importantly, go to Zhang Liao to the northwest.  Defeat him and you'll 
get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhuge Liang
Stage:      Final Conflict at Wuzhang Plains [Shu Xtreme Stage 7, Free Mode

            single allied officer being forced to escape.
Weapon Box: At the area south of Li Dian's and Yue Jin's initial position.
Weapon:     Black Faerie Fan
            Base Attack: 44
            Slash 10, Survival 9, Frenzy 9, Roar 8, Uplift 8
Details:    It will be beneficial to have a multiple quick officer kill setup 
for Zhuge Liang.

Approach the center of the map when the stage starts.  As soon as you arrive, Yu
Jin will be set up on the eastern platform firing catapults at your forces.  You
may want to spend 1 minute to 90 seconds clearing out the officers in the 
center, so that they will have a higher chance of survival since periodically 
the morale of your forces as well as the life bars of your officers will 
decrease as long as the catapults remain active.  

Head over to the east and defeat Cao Ren to open the gate.  You can ignore Dian
Man and head over to Yu Jin and defeat him.  If you defeat Yu Jin without any 
ally officers fleeing within 6 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Liu Bei
Stage:      Defeat Lu Bu [Shu Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat all of Yuan Shu's officers within 10 minutes of starting

            Base Attack: 41
            Frost 10, Harmony 9, Survival 9, Barricade 8, Spurt 8
Details:    The approach to this is going to be the same as getting Guan Yu's 
6th weapon.

A few moments after you enter the castle, Yuan Shu's reinforcements will appear 
to the south, southeast and east.  Defeat Yuan Shu, Ji Ling, Lei Bo and Zhang 
Xun within the 10 minute time limit and you'll get a treasure message.

Weapon:     Radiant Flash Spear
            Base Attack: 49
            Flash 10, Explosive 9, Whirlwind 9, Thorns 8, Resolve
Details:    Proceed through the stage as normal by defeating Yu Jin on the 
eastern platform to stop the catapults.  Just hang out on the platform for the 
time being.  Shortly thereafter, Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan will appear as 
reinforcements to the north, while the Hefei trio will charge out from the 
center gates (Nice Power Ranger-like quote Li Dian).  Zhang Liao will go down 
the west-central path while Yue Jin and Li Dian will go down the east-central 
path.  Drop down from the platform and you can intercept the three officers 
before they can leave the central area.  If you defeat all three officers, 
you'll get a treasure message.

Weapon:     Phoenix Fan
            Base Attack: 44
            Inferno 10, Aggression 9, Explosive 8, Roar 8, Agility
Details:    Similar to Wei Yan's approach, but your goal is to defeat Han Dang 
and you're given two extra minutes.  Be sure to get to 200 kills before moving 
to the northwest portion of the castle.  Break through the gate by defeating 
Ding Feng and meet Han Dang over to the bridge just to the south, then west.  If
you defeat Han Dang before the 10 minute time limit, you'll get a treasure

********************************************************************************

Character:  Yueying
Stage:      Defense of Yong'an [Shu Xtreme Stage 6]
Condition:  Prevent the Wu Forces' generals from entering the Shu Forces'
            main camp and defeat Ding Feng and Zhu Huan within 9 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: North of Ding Feng's starting location.
Weapon:     Holy Light Striker
            Base Attack: 43
            Flash 10, Thorns 9, Barricade 9, Chain 8, Enlightenment 8
Details:    The best way to keep the Wu forces from entering the main camp is to
defeat as many Wu officers as possible in front of the Shu forces.  For now, 
stop the first wave of engineers that are assigned to set a fire attack in your 
area.  Zhu Huan will make his appearance on a platform and will cause an archery
attack near the main camp.  Another wave of engineers will soon follow and 
defeat them again.  Next, an assault unit will go after the main camp from the 
east.  Run over to them and defeat the two officers.  

By now, a third wave of engineers would have come along and likely would have 
set the forest area ablaze by now.  At this point, try to defeat all the 
officers in the burn zone so that your allied forces don't fall quite as easily.
When that's done, take the far south path west and rush up to Zhu Huan.  Defeat 
him and the arrow attack will stop (as well as the morale drops).  Turn around 
and head east over to Ding Feng's position.  Defeat him.  As long as your 
officers are still fending off peons in the forest, no one should be able to 
make it to your main camp.  If the following is completed in the first 9 
minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Jiang Wei
Stage:      Defense of Yong'an [Shu Xtreme Stage 6, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Prevent the fire attack within 6 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: Right outside Liu Shan's main camp.
Weapon:     Rising Flash
            Base Attack: 61
            Inferno 10, Awe 9, Explosive 9, Morass 8, Fury
Details:    The strategy here is similar to Yueying's 6th weapon, only here 
you're worried about the engineers succeeding in the fire attack.  They will 
drop down from platforms to the east and west to the center area.  Make sure 
that you eliminate them ASAP, since there is a timer on how long that they can 
stick around before the area gets burned down.  

There will be four waves of engineers, so you have to move back and forth quite 
a bit to get to them.  Morale maybe an issue for Liu Shan since the assault unit
will likely reach the main camp while you're chasing down engineers as well as 
the constant barrage of arrows from the southwest.  If you defeat the four waves
of engineers without the area being caught on fire in under 6 minutes, you'll 
get a treasure message.


********************************************************************************
Character:  Liu Shan
Stage:      Defense of Yong'an [Shu Xtreme Stage 6]
Condition:  Defeat Ding Feng and Lianshi within 5 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: In the southeast corner of the battlefield.
Weapon:     Destiny Ender
            Base Attack: 44
            Venom 10, Explosive 9, Morass 8, Awareness, Greed
Details:    For this version of this stage, it's best to ignore the engineers 
and head straight to Ding Feng and Lianshi.  If you're confident on how quickly 
you can eliminate officers, go stop Zhu Huan to the southwest to save what 
little morale you have left.  Ding Feng and Lianshi lie to the southeast a short
distance apart.  If you defeat these two officers within 5 minutes, you'll get a
treasure message.

When that is done, head back to your main camp, since the assault unit is likely
putting a hurt on the officer defending the camp.

Character:  Xingcai
Stage:      Defense of Mt. Dingjun [Shu Xtreme Stage 4]

Weapon:     Thunderclap
            Base Attack: 56
            Thunder 10, Flurry 9, Spurt 9, Velocity 8, Rigidity
Details:    Defeat the officers near the main camp, then head up the mountain 
trail to the western side of the map northward.  Defeat Wang Yi along the way 
and put a stop to Zhang He attacking Liu Bei to the northwest.  Guo Huai is 
located to the southeast of where you'll find Liu Bei.  If all three officers 
are defeated in the first 7 minutes of the stage, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Ma Dai
Stage:      Revenge at Yiling [Shu Xtreme Stage 5, Free Mode Only]
Condition:  Carry out Fa Zheng's plot within 14 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: At the garrison southwest of Zhu Ran's initial location.
Weapon:     Precious Frost Brush
            Base Attack: 43
            Frost 10, Induction 9, Spurt 8, Rigidity, Desperation
Details:    With 14 minutes as the time restriction, there's plenty to do to 
make sure that Fa Zheng's strategy is a success.

Make your way through the stone sentinel maze and be sure to eliminate any 
officers and torch troops, since they will slow Liu Bei's progress if he's left 
alone.  By the time you approach the exit to the east, Lu Xun will start sending
the fire attack unit to the forest.  Try to take no more than 4 minutes to get 
to this point.

The officers that head up the fire attack units will attack at opposite ends, so
it's suggested that you have some bodyguards equipped ahead of time and have 
them secure the location at one of the ends of the attack zone (Northeastern 
Garrison First Garrison or Northeastern Garrison Fourth Garrison; I placed mine 
at the First garrison before the turn westward) so that they can slow the 
progress of the fire attack units.  While the bodyguards and hopefully some of 
the Shu officers are taking care of the fire attack units to the northeast, head
over to the central area and take care of the attack from the south side.  Zhu 
Ran will also send another set of fire attack units, so you'll have two officers
attacking from south and two from the east for a combined total of four 
officers.  Once the two officers on one side are eliminated, head over to the 
other side and take care of the other two.  If at any point the officers sneak 
into the fire attack zone, the fire attack will occur and you will fail.

Once the fire attack has been squelched, the next step is to get the ambush 
units set up in place.  In order to do that, you'll have to clear the area of 
enemy officers.  The northeast may have one or two remaining, but your allies 
can clear that area without too much babysitting.  The bigger concern needs to 
be focused on the southwest side anyway.  You'll have Zhuge Jin and Ding Feng 
(NPC) among others to defeat, plus Zhu Zhi in the garrison just before the 
ambush point.  Use musou or rage attacks if needed.  If all goes well, Guan Suo 
and Zhang Bao will withdraw to the northeast and Zhao Yun and Guan Xing will 
hide to the southwest.

Next, lure either Zhu Ran or Lu Xun to the fire attack zone (Zhu Ran-central 
area, Lu Xun-northeast).  They will set the forest ablaze.  Now retreat to the 
northeast corner of the map.  If this is accomplished in the first 14 minutes, 
you'll get a treasure message.  You'll get the message before Liu Bei gives the 
order to attack.

with Zhang Fei and Guan Ping, get the ambush units set up within 5 minutes and 
lure Xiahou Yuan, Zhang He and Xu Zhu to the center.  When the ambush succeeds, 
head over to Jia Xu's position in the garrison to the south of Cao Cao and

            Base Attack: 44
            Venom 10, Thorns 9, Jolt 9, Uplift 8, Agility
Details:    Depending on how quickly you can reach Liu Bei and achieve Fa 
Zheng's strategy, Xiahou Ba and Xu Huang can be tough to beat or be a run-of-
the-mill skirmish.  You first run into Xiahou Ba and Xu Huang when Fa Zheng asks
you to lure the Wei forces in the northeast to the ballistae unit.  If you have 
the time, you can lure them to the ambush zone and the two officers will lose 
their hyper status; otherwise you may have to beat them in their hyper state if 
you're running short of time.  

In any case, if Xiahou Ba and Xu Huang are defeated in the first 7 minutes, 
you'll get a treasure message.

pyro brothers in the first 10 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

To get the weapon box, you'll have to backtrack some in order to get it.  Just 
be sure that you have a fast horse and fast officer killing abilities in order

Weapon:     Demon Beard
            Base Attack: 46
            Slash 10, Survival 9, Spurt 9, Awe 8, Fury
Details:    Time is a factor in the early going, but the requirements aren't too
difficult.  First, rescue all of your loving family in the order of Shi, Zhao 
and Zhang Chunhua by defeating each of the officers that they're engaged with.  
Once they're rescued, go through the western portion of the castle and eliminate
the officers and commanders along the way to open the gates.

Once you arrive into the castle, you'll get a message that messengers are trying
to contact Xiahou Ba in order for him to defect.  The first messenger will go 
from the north to the central room.  Eliminate him before he reaches the door.  
The next messenger will arrive from the northeast and will go to the eastern 
door of the central room.  This will require some back-tracking and heading over
to the eastern gate guarded by a Unit Commander.  Eliminate the Unit Commander 
and head over to the messenger and eliminate him before he reaches Xiahou Ba.  
The last messenger will take the same route as the first, so head back over to 
the center of the map and eliminate him.

Once the messengers are taken care of, head to the central room to open up the 
doors and Xiahou Ba will join your forces.  If this is done within 8 minutes, 
you'll get a treasure message.

Each of them will have two officers except the southeast location.  Be sure to 
defeat Xu Zhi, Zhang Bao, Mai Dai and Ding Feng (NPC) before beating Xu Zhu, 
Zhang Fei, Ma Chao and Ding Feng (playable), respectively; if not, the former 
set of officers will flee and you won't have a chance to add them to the 
collector count.  The southeast location will have some bandits in the area, but
you need to defeat the main one to get the next ingredient.  

The last ingredient to the southwest becomes available after you clear the area 
of tigers.  The officer duo there are King Mulu and Meng Huo.  Again, be sure to

and the north and south ends of the main door of the castle.  The assassin to 
the southwest should be very close to you.  Go ahead and eliminate him.  Head up
to the castle gate and take care of the other two assassins.  

Once they're out of the way, go and meet the three officers that you need to 
defect.  One is located in the corner to the northwest, the second is at the 
port in the north-central area and the third in a fort over to the east.  Defeat
them before Zhong Hui's main unit arrives and they will defect.  If this is 
accomplished in the first 15 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

Character:  Zhang Chunhua
Stage:      Riot at Luoyang [Jin Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Enter the throne room within 10 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: Along the western pathway outside the throne room.

OTHERS [OTHERS6TH]

Character:  Diaochan
Stage:      Uprising at Chang'an [Lu Bu Historical Stage 3]
Condition:  Defeat Zuo Ling, Zhu Jun, Song Guo, Niu Fu and Hu Feng within 4
            minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: The northeast room from the first bridge you cross.
Weapon:     Graceful Aster
            Base Attack: 48
            Cyclone 10, Jubilation 9, Vigor 9, Roar 8, Aggression 8
Details:    This is another stage where Diaochan has to defeat multiple officers
in a short amount of time.  Using her R1+O musou and/or a Cyclone attributed 
weapon will help as an officer killer.  

Fortunately, the path here is fairly direct.  The only problem that you'll run 
into is the last officer (Hu Feng) will be accompanied by tigers.  Once you 
defeat the laundry list of officers within 4 minutes, you'll get a treasure 
message as well as some tigers to play with for the rest of the stage.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Lu Bu
Stage:      Recapture of Chang'an [Lu Bu Hypothetical Stage 9]
Condition:  Defeat Zhenji, Zhang He and Yuan Shao within 10 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: Near Yuan Shao's initial position.
Weapon:     Explosive Halberd
            Base Attack: 79
            Thunder 10, Velocity 8, Harmony 8, Swiftness, Fury
Details:    This is a test on a big stage.  As usual, killing officers quickly 
is essential, for not only the targeted officers but everyone else in between.  
Fortunately, you get to play as Lu Bu in which you can spam the dual halberd 
switch attack (increased attack and attack speed) as often as you like to 
decimate foes quickly.  

You'll start over to the south and Chen Gong will get the ram to the first gate.
Once the ram is on the move, Yan Liang and Wen Chou will intercept it.  
Eliminate them to keep the ram on the move.  Then, Zhang He will activate the 
ballistae causing the ram to stop.  The first target is Yuan Shao over to the 
southwest.  Rush over and dispatch him and try to take 10-15 seconds with each 
officer along the way.  Use the halberd switch attack if needed.  If time is an 
issue defeating officers, pack some bodyguards with you ahead of time and have 
them attack the officers near Chen Gong.  The bodyguards will also help Chen 
Gong survive the battle.

Head over to the east and defeat Zu Mao who heads that ballistae unit.  You can 
ignore the officers that Zhenji sends from the castle, since they will follow 
you up to the east instead of going after Chen Gong.  Next is Cheng Pu, beat him
to open the waterway entrance.  A Wu ambush unit will show up in the waterway 
consisting of Sun Shangxiang, Huang Gai and Han Dang.  The officers from 
Zhenji's unit will follow you into here and you can take everyone out in one 
fell swoop.  Defeat them to advance to the next area.  You can ignore the 
officers as you go up the steps.  At the top of the stairs is Zhenji, defeat 
her.  Head west along the walkway until you reach Zhang He and you can take him 
out and (finally) silence the ballistae attack.  

I hope that Chen Gong is still holding up fine, since you may get a message or 
two indicating that he is struggling.  If you take care of the aforementioned 
within 10 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

Character:  Dong Zhuo
Stage:      Ultimate Warrior Competition [Others Xtreme Stage 3]
Condition:  Defeat Sun Jian and Huang Gai within 7 minutes of starting the
            battle.
Weapon Box: At the area east of the battle arena.
Weapon:     Unavoidable Bomb
            Base Attack: 61
            Inferno 10, Vigor 9, Frenzy 9, Morass 8, Swiftness
Details:    To begin the tournament you will face your toughest 
opponent...message spam.  About 25 seconds of it will take place in the 
beginning.  If you're worried about time, do an interim save at the beginning, 
exit out and reload; if you're adept at killing officers, this stage will be no 
sweat.  You will fight four officers one-on-one in a row, Han Dang and Xiahou 
Yuan being the final two.  When you are finished, Sun Jian, Huang Gai along with
several Wu officers and troops will attack you in the arena.  Defeat Sun Jian 
and Huang Gai in under 7 minutes and you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Yuan Shao
Stage:      Nobility Face-off [Others Xtreme Stage 5]
Condition:  [Wang Yun] To recognize the Yuan family as 1st place within 10
            minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: At the center garrison where Wang Yun is stationed.
Weapon:     Twisted Crystal Spiker
            Base Attack: 43
            Frost 10, Jubilation 9, Velocity 9, Survival 8, Protection 8
Details:    This competition requires some work to be done in order to prove the
superiority of the nobility.  Personally, I'm not the best with Yuan Shao with 
his EX weapon, so I had to use the halberd switch attack as well as Hex Mark 
(Shadow ability) to get this weapon.

The first part of the competition, you are asked to defeat the most officers in 
the least amount of time.  Sun Jian and Cao Cao are no slouches and you will see
reports that they have defeated several officers themselves.  Go from the 
northwest to the northeast eliminating each non-playable officers down the line.
Diaochan will march her way from the central fort over to your location, but it 
will take some time for her to get to you.  From my method, I had to backtrack 
to her after defeating the first four officers.  You can beat her in between if 
you like, but the bottom line is that you need to defeat all five officers 
around 2:30 into the stage, otherwise Cao Cao or Sun Jian will be the victor.  
The faster you finish, the more time that you have for the second part of the 
competition.

The second part of the competition is to feed the peasants.  This one can be 
annoying because you have to keep the supply units on the move with their 
tortoise-like pace.  The best advice I have for winning this part is as
follows:

-Throughout the transport, take out EVERY PEON.  The supply troop will try to 
engage them with lackadaisical effort and will eat up lots of time that can be 
better used for them to run over to the northeastern garrison.
-Beat Cai Wenji as soon as she shows up outside the central garrison.  Even 
though she isn't near the supply troop, they won't move until she is gone.
-Next, you'll run into a bandit ambush party to the northwest.  The supply troop
won't move past the garrison until they are gone.
-As soon as it's safe for the supply troop to resume their advance, another 
bandit ambush awaits them to the east of the northwest garrison.  Once again, 
eliminate all the enemies so that the path is clear.  There are some clumps of 
peons just up ahead.  Be sure to slay them too.
-Don't be concerned about Sun Jian and Cao Cao feeding their constituents first.
The main thing is to make sure all of your supply captains are alive.
-Just as soon as the supply troop is ready to enter the garrison to feed the 
peasants, another bandit ambush party will come along and will bring ballistae 
with them.  I hope you have a Shadow horse as well as a strong horse attack, 
because it's best to take out the ballistae on horseback since they are the 
biggest threat to the supply troops' health.  Take care of the bandit officers 
as well.  As you are pushing the bandits and ballistae back, the supply troops 
will slowly trickle in and feed the peasants.  Hopefully, you have all of your 
supply captains alive and moving, since when I did this I got all 5 captains in 
the garrison with 15 seconds to spare.

If you win the first part of the competition and get all 5 supply captains in 
the garrison before the 10 minutes are up, Wang Yun will announce the Yuans are 
the winner and you'll get a treasure message...after about a minute of message 
spam so just be patient.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Zhang Jiao
Stage:      Assistance at Runan [Others Xtreme Stage 1]
Condition:  Defeat Li Dian within 10 minutes of starting the battle.
Weapon Box: In the southwest room from Li Dian's initial position.
Weapon:     Possessed Staff
            Base Attack: 56
            Venom 10, Roar 9, Enlightenment 9, Aggression 8, Awareness
Details:    From the starting position, head over to the west and eliminate all 
the officers along the way, including the one on the platform.  Once that's 
done, Yue Jin will show up.  Defeat him and you will be able to summon phantom 
soldiers and move to the north.  Defeat the next two officers.   Rendezvous with
Liu Bei and eliminate the officers that Liu Bei's forces are engaged with.  Keep
moving along until you run into Zhang He and a set of ballistae.  Defeat him and
move towards the corridor where Li Dian is.  Head all the way to the southeast 
corner and meet up with Cheng Yuanzhi to start the fire attack.  This will open 
up the doors to where Li Dian is located.  Go and defeat him.  If this is done 
in the first 10 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Meng Huo
Stage:      Protect the Animals [Others Xtreme Stage 6]
Condition:  Defeat Yuan Shao, Xiaoqiao and Yueying within 6 minutes of
            starting the battle.
Weapon Box: The east corner near the north reinforcement gate on the
            battlefield.
Weapon:     Manic Thunder Gloves
            Base Attack: 65
            Thunder 10, Roar 9, Spurt 8, Harmony 8, Resolve
Details:    Back to the self-explanatory stages.  You actually can summon a 
horse in Nanzhong this go-around, so go ahead and take advantage since you'll 
have some running around to do in a short amount of time.  The first target is 
Yuan Shao to the northeast of your starting location.  Defeat him.  Next, beat 
Xiaoqiao en route to the central garrison from the west and finally Yueying in 
the garrison to the northeast.  If the three officers listed are defeated within
the first 6 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

Condition:  Defeat Yuan Shao and Xiaoqiao before they can get close to the
            animals.
Weapon Box: Along the pathway south of the west reinforcement gate on the
            battlefield.
Weapon:     Enchanted Lotus
            Base Attack: 44
            Venom 10, Thorns 9, Agility, Rigidity, Desperation
Details:    You want to make sure that neither Yuan Shao or Xiaoqiao enter the 
garrisons where the animals are.  If you get the message “X is quickly 
approaching the animals!”, you will fail.  Yuan Shao will arrive on the eastern 
edge of the map (northeast of your initial location) and Xiaoqiao will arrive 
from the west.  If you stop Yuan Shao and Xiaoqiao before they break through the
garrisons, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

            Inferno 10, Triumph 9, Aggression 9, Protection 8, Uplift 8
Details:    Similar to Zhang Jiao's procedure, but your main objective is to 
defeat Zhang He.  Be wary of the ballistae that surround the beautiful one.  If 
Zhang He is defeated in the first 8 minutes, you'll get a treasure message.

********************************************************************************

Character:  Chen Gong
Stage:      Repulsion at Guandu [Lu Bu Hypothetical Stage 8]
Condition:  Defeat Zhang He within 5 minutes of starting the battle without
            a single allied officer being forced to escape.
Weapon Box: From Zhang He's position, go north across the bridge then head
            east towards the area between the garrison and the river.
Weapon:     Divine Oracle Scroll
            Base Attack: 53
            Flash 10, Awe 9, Fear 8, Protection 8, Rigidity
Details:    Start by defeating the two officers just to the north of your 
starting location.  You may get a call for help over at the southern garrison, 
so head over there and fend off the enemy.

Once things are under control, head over to Yanjin (south-central garrison) and 
defeat Zhang He.  He will spring an ambush, but if you're able to defeat Zhang 
He in the first 5 minutes without any of your allies fleeing, you'll get a 
treasure message.

********************************************************************************

drawbridge and beat Zhang Fei.  From there, you'll have to head to the 
southeast.  If you have time, lure Cao Cao's forces to the ambush spot, 
otherwise press on.  

You'll have to eliminate a couple of Unit Commanders to secure the catapult in 
front of the gate.  From there, defeat Jian Yong to put a stop to the arrow 
attack as well as to gain access to Guan Yu.  Go ahead and finish the God of War
off.

If Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are defeated in the first 8 minutes (last time I 
promise), you'll get a treasure message.
